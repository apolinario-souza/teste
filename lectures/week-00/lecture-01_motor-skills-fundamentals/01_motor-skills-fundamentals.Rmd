# Learning objectives

1. Define and distinguish the terms **skills/actions**, **abilities**, **movements**, and **reflexes**, and give examples of each.

2. Identify and describe **three influences** on how we perform a motor skill.

3. Define and distinguish **four characteristics** of motor skills.

## We can .grey[categorize] skills into one of three domains

.black[COGNITIVE SKILLS]: Depend on an individual's **knowledge and mental abilities**

.black[PERCEPTUAL SKILLS]: Depend on an individual's ability to **recognize and discriminate** among various sources of perceivable stimuli

.black[MOTOR SKILLS]: Depend on an individuals **quality of movement**

#### *Cognition and perception exist fundamentally to subserve action and are intrinsically linked to the motor system and to the acquisition of skill behaviours*

## .grey[Motor] skills are...

- goal-directed and performed voluntarily
- require movements of joints and body segments via muscular contractions
- need to be learned (or relearned)

### Motor skills vs reflexes

## .grey[Motor] skills are...

- goal-directed and performed voluntarily
- require movements of joints and body segments via muscular contractions
- need to be learned (or relearned)

### Motor skills vs abilities

**Relatively stable and enduring traits** typically regarded as having been either **genetically inherited** or developed during **growth and maturation**

- Abilities are **not** easily modifiable by practice or experience

- Abilities **underlie** motor skills

- E.g., reaction time, hand-eye coordination, dexterity

### Motor skills vs movements

Component parts of a skill that are **observable and measurable**

## Why is it important to .grey[distinguish] between motor skills and movements?

.footnote[<sup>1</sup>Will see this in the *Measuring motor performance* lectures]

- Humans learn **motor skills** (i.e., actions), we do not learn movements

- As we learn skills, the movements that make them up become **adaptable** to move successfully in our environment

- Movements and motor skills are **assessed/evaluated/measured** differently<sup>1</sup>
  - **motor skills** are typically evaluated in terms of **outcome**
  
  - **movements** are typically evaluated in terms of how they are **produced**

---

## Characteristics of .grey[skilled performance]

.footnote[<sup>2</sup>Guthrie 1952]

"*the ability to bring about some end result with maximum certainty and minimum outlay of energy, or of time and energy*"<sup>2</sup>

- **Maximum certainty of goal attainment**
  - repeatedly being successful

- **Minimum energy expenditure**
  - decrease physical and mental exertion required

- **Minimum movement time**
  - performance quality remains high with reduced time required to execute it
