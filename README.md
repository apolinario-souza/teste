## Course schedule

This course is delivered using a module approach. Module 1 covers Motor Control and is taught by Mike in Fall 2021. Module 2 covers Motor Learning and is taught by Brad in Fall 2021. The available motor learning slides are those used by Mike when he teaches both Modules. As such, the motor learning slides are subject to change.

**Course notes**

<sup>a</sup>This lecture has been moved from the original schedule. As a result, the lecture on *Classes of control* has been removed. An overview of the content from the *Classes of control* lecture will be presented in the *Action preparation: Information-processing* lecture. You can, however, access the slides for the *Classes of control* lecture [here][8].
